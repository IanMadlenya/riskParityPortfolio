Welcome to riskParityPortfolio!
===============================

``riskParityPortfolio`` allows users to design portfolios that meet the risk parity criteria.
We solve the underlying optimization problem using three approaches: 1) A Newton method
for simple risk parity design, 2) applying general non linear constrained optimization solvers
such as ``alabama`` and ``slsqp``, and 2) applying the successive convex approximation (SCA) described in
`Feng & Palomar (2016) <http://www.ece.ust.hk/~palomar/Publications_files/2015/FengPalomar-TSP2015%20-%20risk_parity_portfolio.pdf>`_.

See the `Getting started <_static/getting_started.html>`_ tutorial for a comparison
between approaches.
